Assignment #2 – Process Automation 
Due Date: Friday, 13 December 2024, @23:59 pm (midnight) 
In this assignment you will be asked to write a script using AutoHotkey framework.  
AutoHotkey (AHK) is a free, open-source scripting language designed for automating the 
Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface) and general scripting. With AutoHotkey, you can 
create custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks, remap keys, create macros, and perform 
various other automation functions on your Windows computer.  
The target application will be the windows application called “cse303keygen.exe”. Your script 
will read input serials from a txt file called “serials.txt”.  You are responsible for loading this 
text file and performing the operations using this  application. In order to control the app you 
will develop AutoHotkey scripts. After each key generation, you will append the result in 
“out-groupid.txt” file in the same order. If you are group78 then it is “out-group78.txt”. Also 
your report will be named like “group78-report.pdf” Figure 1 shows the user interface of the 
application. 

You script must: 
• Execute this application (cse303keygen.exe). 
• Provide aserial number from the tet file e.g  123456  
• Then press the “Generate” button to generate the key from the serial 
• After that append the result in the out.txt file. 

Submission: 
You should send your ahk file as “groupid.ahk” and assignment report (15p).  
Those who submit their homework late will be penalized 10 points per day. 
Rules: - Upload your ahk file and your report to MS Teams. - If you use additional software/technology, then provide a “requirements.txt” file as well.
